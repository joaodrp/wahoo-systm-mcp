# Wahoo SYSTM MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to Wahoo SYSTM calendar and workout data. This allows Claude and other MCP clients to interact with your Wahoo SYSTM training plan, retrieve planned workouts, and get detailed workout information including intervals and power zones.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Securely authenticate with your Wahoo SYSTM account
- **Calendar Access**: Retrieve planned workouts for any date range
- **Library Browsing**: Browse and search the complete Wahoo SYSTM workout library with filters for sport, level, duration, and channel
- **Workout Details**: Get comprehensive workout information including:
  - Workout intervals and structure
  - Power zones (FTP, MAP, AC, NM)
  - Duration and intensity
  - Equipment requirements
  - TSS (Training Stress Score) and IF (Intensity Factor)
- **Rider Profile**: Access your 4DP profile values

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Option 1: 1Password Integration (Recommended)

Store your credentials securely in 1Password and reference them via the `op` CLI.

1. **Install 1Password CLI** if you haven't already: https://1password.com/downloads/command-line

2. **Store your Wahoo SYSTM credentials in 1Password**

3. **Configure Claude Desktop** with 1Password secret references:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wahoo-systm": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/wahoo-systm-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WAHOO_USERNAME_1P_REF": "op://Your-Vault/Your-Item-Name/username",
        "WAHOO_PASSWORD_1P_REF": "op://Your-Vault/Your-Item-Name/password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the references with your actual 1Password item references. Format is: `op://vault/item/field`

To find your vault and item names, use:
```bash
op vault list
op item list
```

**Important**: Make sure you have enabled 1Password CLI desktop app integration. See the [1Password CLI documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/) for setup instructions.

The server will automatically authenticate on startup using these credentials.

### Option 2: Environment Variables (Plain Text)

**Warning**: This stores credentials in plain text. Only use this if you don't have 1Password.

Configure Claude Desktop with plain environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wahoo-systm": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/wahoo-systm-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WAHOO_USERNAME": "your_email@example.com",
        "WAHOO_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server will automatically authenticate on startup using these credentials.

## Usage

### Adding to Claude Desktop

See configuration options above for the full setup.

```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Watch Mode (for development)

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests will use credentials from a `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your 1Password references or plain credentials.

## API Information

This server uses the Wahoo SYSTM GraphQL API at `https://api.thesufferfest.com/graphql`. The implementation is based on reverse-engineering the web app's API calls.

## Security Notes

- Credentials are only stored in memory during the session
- The `.env` file is gitignored to prevent accidental commits
- Authentication tokens are not persisted between server restarts
- 1Password integration provides the most secure credential management
